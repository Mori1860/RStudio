Key Insights from 730K Worker Analysis

Visualization Patterns:

    Clear positive correlation between job satisfaction and salary across all degree levels

    Professional degrees command highest salaries, followed by Doctorate, Master's, and Bachelor's degrees

Regression Reveals Deeper Story:
While salary and satisfaction appear linked, job-education alignment emerged as the strongest predictor (-0.3 effect for misalignment). The highest satisfaction and earnings occur when advanced degrees align with high-value fields like economics and health.

Strategic Takeaway: Optimal career outcomes require not just educational investment but strategic alignment between degree, field, and roleâ€”demonstrating that proper job-education fit can outweigh salary alone in driving satisfaction.

Salary Progression Pattern: The graph shows a clear positive relationship between job satisfaction and salary across all degree levels, with all regression lines sloping upward from "Very Low" to "Very High" satisfaction.

Degree-Level Differentiation:

    Professional degrees consistently command the highest salaries at every satisfaction level

    Doctorate degrees follow closely, showing strong earning potential

    Master's degrees maintain a solid mid-range position

    Bachelor's degrees show the lowest salary levels across satisfaction categories

Connecting to Your Regression Findings:

The Satisfaction-Salary Paradox: While the graph shows higher satisfaction correlates with higher salaries, your regression reveals this isn't the full story. The strongest predictor was actually job-education alignment (with a -0.3 effect for misalignment), suggesting that:

    Alignment Overrides Salary: Workers in roles that match their education report higher satisfaction even when salaries are moderate

    Professional/Economics Advantage: The highest satisfaction and salaries occur when advanced degrees (especially professional degrees) align with high-value fields like economics and health

    The Misalignment Penalty: The -0.3 effect indicates that working outside one's educational field substantially reduces satisfaction, which may explain why some higher-paid individuals report lower satisfaction

Strategic Insight: The graph likely captures the "success cases" where educational investment, field choice, and job alignment converge to create both high satisfaction and high earnings, particularly in economics and health sectors.

The visualization shows the reward for optimal education-career alignment, while your regression reveals the significant cost of misalignment that isn't immediately apparent in the salary-satisfaction relationship.
